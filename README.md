# flutter_web

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for making a workflow CI/CD of Flutter Web application on github pages

1. Copy the whole directory to your flutter project

.github/workflows/flutter_web.yml

update flutter_web line 21 
```
--base-href "/flutter_web/" to your repository name
```

2. On your github project page, go to Settings tab -> Pages -> build and deployment -> source, then select Github Actions

3. Git push your local flutter project to github and your project will start building in Actions tab

You are done! you can browse the flutter web application e.g. https://ufo888.github.io/flutter_web

If you like my flutter_web github page starter project, please give me a Star.

Enjoy coding!
